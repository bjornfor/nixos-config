popwk - power on/off projector with keyboard

Usage: $prog <projector_ipaddr>

Monitor the first Logitech unifying receiver found (my keyboard) and send
PJLINK network command to the projector to power on/off according to the
current power state of the input device. Before powering off the projector,
a desktop notification is sent, giving the user feedback about what's about
to happen, and the ability to abort (by powering on the keyboard).

For added robustness, a few consecutive "off" keyboard states must be
sampled before the keyboard is assumed to be off. This prevents spurious
off-events.

For this program to work, the projector must:
* be configured with "communication on" in standby mode
* not have any PJLINK password
